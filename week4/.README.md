data structure -- graph
weighted vs unweighted
directed vs undirected graph
connected vs unconnected
strongly connected vs weakly connected

- adjacency list: O(N+E)
- adj matrix: O(N^2)

### how to know if 2 nodes are connected?:

- breadth first: queue(useful for shortest path)
- deepth first: stack(when to mark as visited: when push(most time preferred) or when pop )
  - with recuresion:
    > if dfs(child)=='found': return found
- Dijkstra's algorithm

### page rank

- random surfer model

# homework

1: implement find shortest path from one page to another
2: impelment find most popular page, calculate top 10 page rank
3: impelement find longest path without repeated pages (NP-hard)(hint: find order of traverse)

### find shortest path

- I first considered use a adjacency matrix, and realized it's impossible
  - Memory requirement (PBs of memory)
  - inefficiency for sparse dataset
  - matrix operations at large scale is costy

### find most popular page (page rank)

- use a local DB
- use adj list iteratively
- External memory algorithms
- block wise processing

**key learned**

#### adj matrix vs list:

- when link density > 50%
- frequent edge loopkups (matrix: O(1), list: O(E))
- matrix based algorithms: Random walk, Floyd Warshall, Graph clustering, Page Rank...
- mathematical operations (graph powers, linear algebra related analysing)
- vector related operations
