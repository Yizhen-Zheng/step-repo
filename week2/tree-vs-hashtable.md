# accessibility:

- tree is sorted, easy to get associated values

# scalibility:

- tree is fractal structure, makes it easier to split into smaller ones and maintain the structure
- (compared to hashtable, we need to rehash them when growing or shrinking)
- lead to deploy in distributed databases
