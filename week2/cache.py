'''
Implement a data structure that stores the most recently accessed N pages.
See the below test cases to see how it should work.

Note: Please do not use a library like collections.OrderedDict). The goal is to implement the data structure yourself!

observe the history, pick pages with higher probability
pick most recent x pages

requiremets:
input: (url,page)

implement a hash table with fixed size (X)
store the key value as <url, webpage> pair
be able to get time series order
    specifically, we want to know the key of the oldest one in O(1)
    intuitively, use something like a queue
    delete in list in O(1)(or pserform shift in O(1))
    use 2 pointers to keep watching head and tail in a fixed size queue
