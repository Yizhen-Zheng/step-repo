# hashtable and cache implementation

implement hashtable data structure and a least-recently-used cache from scratch using list and doubly linked lists in Python.

## overview

**Hash Table Performance:**

- Average case: O(1) for get/put/delete
- Worst case: O(n) during rehashing (amortized O(1))
- Load factor: 0.3 - 0.7 for optimal performance

### code review:

-

> Note:
> Those marked which 'after research' or similar words are implemented after look up resources
> I do search websites or ask AI for specific topics once hit the time limitation I set for myself to avoid perfectionism and use the whole week on it.
