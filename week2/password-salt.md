A password salt is a random string added to a password before it's hashed. This process helps prevent rainbow table attacks and dictionary attacks, making it harder for hackers to crack passwords, even if they can access the hashed passwords.

Why:
Limitation of hash without salting
Using frequent password and the same hash function, the user's pwd can be found
